# TF-NLP
Notes and code for the implementation of neural machine translation, image captioning, text classification, and language modelling from the Tensorflow NLP tutorials. The notebooks contain implementations of the Transformer and various attention mechanisms, RNNs, and fine-tuning BERT on various NLP tasks. Notes were written in my own words.

The code was obtained from the tensorflow tutorials on natural language processing

https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials

Topics covered and implemented:

-Warm starting embeddings  
-Implementation of skip-gram word2vec embedding  
-Embedding visualizations  
-Tokenization with Tensorflow  
-Sentiment Analysis with RNNs and LSTMs on the IMDB Dataset  
-Finetuning BERT on the GLUE Benchmark  
-Translating Spanish to English with an attention based encoder decoder model  
-Translating Portuguese to English with a Transformer  
-Visualizing attention maps  
-Image Captioning with a Transformer
