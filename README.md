# TF-NLP
Notes and code for the implementation of neural machine translation, image captioning, text classification, and language modelling from the Tensorflow NLP tutorials. The notebooks contain implementations of the Transformer and various attention mechanisms, RNNs, and fine-tuning BERT on various NLP tasks. Notes were written in my own words.

The code was obtained from the tensorflow tutorials on natural language processing
